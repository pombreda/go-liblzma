/**
 * \brief       Calculates the alignment of the encoded output
 *
 * Knowing the alignment of the output data is useful e.g. in the Block
 * encoder which tries to align the Compressed Data field optimally.
 *
 * \param       filters   Pointer to lzma_filter array, whose last
 *                        member must have .id = LZMA_VLI_VALUE_UNKNOWN.
 * \param       guess     The value to return if the alignment of the output
 *                        is the same as the alignment of the input data.
 *                        If you want to always detect this special case,
 *                        this guess to zero; this function never returns
 *                        zero unless guess is zero.
 *
 * \return      In most cases, a small positive integer is returned;
 *              for optimal use, the encoded output of this filter
 *              chain should start at on offset that is a multiple of
 *              the returned integer value.
 *
 *              If the alignment of the output is the same as the input
 *              data (which this function cannot know), \a guess is
 *              returned.
 *
 *              If an error occurs (that is, unknown Filter IDs or filter
 *              options), UINT32_MAX is returned.
