/**
 * \brief       Allocates and initializes a new lzma_memlimit structure
 *
 * It is easy to make liblzma to use huge amounts of memory. This can
 * be a problem especially with the decoder, since it a file requiring
 * huge amounts of memory to uncompress could allow even a denial of
 * service attack if the memory usage wasn't limited.
 *
 * liblzma provides a set of functions to control memory usage. Pointers
 * to these functions can be used in lzma_allocator structure, which makes
 * it easy to limit memory usage with liblzma.
 *
 * The memory limiter functions are not tied to limiting memory usage
 * with liblzma itself. You can use them with anything you like.
 *
 * In multi-threaded applications, only one thread at once may use the same
 * lzma_memlimit structure. If there is a need, this limitation may
 * be removed in future versions without breaking the libary API/ABI.
 *
 * \param       limit   Initial memory usage limit in bytes
 *
 * \return      Pointer to allocated and initialized lzma_memlimit
 *              structure. On error, NULL is returned. The reason behind
 *              an error is either that malloc() failed or that the given
 *              limit was so small that it didn't allow allocating even
 *              the lzma_memlimit structure itself.
 *
 * \note        Excluding lzma_memlimit_usage(), the functions whose name begin
 *              lzma_memlimit_ can be used even if lzma_init() hasn't been
 *              called.
